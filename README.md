## Comments

Rating app uses two databases. One free open database with movies and firebase realtime database for custom ratings.
Because of time limitations no stage managers were used. Application is not optimized to perfection.

Search input is not that "smart" because of movies database search limitations.

Thank you for this opportunity :)
